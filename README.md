# CmeleonTwist
a wip decomp of chameleon twist (1997)
currently jp only, but tbf literally every version is basically the same so lol
## HOW TO DO
- `git clone --recursive <this link>`
^ to get that juicy goodness
everything should be set up, `cd /mnt/whateverYourDriveIs/cmeleontwist` and run
- `make setup`
then run
- `make`
if ya wanna clean it out and start over do `make clean`, i removed a bit where it removed the rom just in case so lol
